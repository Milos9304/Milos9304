Hi 🖐️ I'm **Miloš** from Slovakia 🇸🇰 and welcome to my **GitHub**!

Currently I am a PhD student 🧑‍🎓 at **School of Informatics @ Edinburgh university** 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

I am mostly interested in **quantum computing** :atom:, **cryptography** 🧮 and **optimization** 📈

My repositories contain mostly supplementary code to my research projects, though I aim to publish everything I find useful just for a rare case that somebody might like it 🤷‍♂️
